You can simplify your code using `setUp`.

Now, you can use setUp method to create a `WasRun` instance.

Please pass the test below on Playground.
( Same as the previous test )
```
(TestCazeTest name: 'testRunning') run
(TestCazeTest name: 'testSetUp') run
```

If the test is success, nothing is happened.
If the test is failed, you will see some stacktrace.
